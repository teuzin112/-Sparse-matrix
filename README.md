# -Sparse-matrix
Simple project realized during the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures



For the proper compilation and execution of the program, it is recommended to create a project in
CodeBlocks with the source files.

It is important to point out that the program loads a maximum of two matrices at a time in the
memory for performing operations.

If you use the load file option (option 6), the word that indicates which operation should be
performed must be one of these: “soma” for addtion, “subtracao” for subtraction, “multiplicacao” for multiplication, “transposta” for tranpose or
“simetrica” for symmetric.
